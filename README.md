App for playing music from an interesting game I play sometimes called Destiny.

Is a basic app, but only I want to practice with Framework of Apple AVFoundation an other things like Autolayout.  All rights to license both music and content are the property of the trademarks, the content is privately owned Destiny - Rise of Iron. Thank you at https://thenounproject.com/ for icons.
